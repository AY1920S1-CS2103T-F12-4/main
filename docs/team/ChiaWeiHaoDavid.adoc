== Introduction

=== Purpose of portfolio
The purpose of this portfolio is to document my overall contributions to the Software Engineering project, *Billboard*.

=== About the project
In the Software Engineering Module _CS2103T_, My team of 5 students were tasked with enhancing an existing addressbook desktop application for our project.
We decided to transform the base code of the aforementioned addressbook application into a personal financial management system called *Billboard*, targeted at students.

This enhanced application enables students to record their daily expenses and has advanced expense tracking and management features.
The advanced features for *tracking* expenses are generating graphs from expense data, and filtering capabilities; while
the advanced features for *managing* expenses are tagging and archiving expenses.

Since *Billboard* has a Command Line Interface (CLI), meaning that all interactions between user and the application is done through typing only, it is meant for students who
type fast. Furthermore, *Billboard* also has a fully functioning Graphical User Interface (GUI), making it user friendly.

This is what our project looks like:

The role I played in this project was to design and implement the code for the `archive` feature. Additionally, I was
tasked with improving the application's aesthetic design by adding major cosmetic tweaks to the application's GUI.
The following sections illustrate these enhancements in greater detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and
developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

Note the following formatting used in this document:

[NOTE]
This symbol indicates important information.

`archive` - A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application.

`ArchiveWrapper` - Blue text with grey highlight indicates a component, class or object in the architecture of the application.


== Summary of contributions
This section provides a quick summary of my coding, documentation, and other meaningful contributions to *Billboard*.

* *Major enhancement*: I added all archive related functions.

** What it does: My enhancement allows the user to create archives, add an expense to an archive, revert/"unarchive" an archived expense and permanently delete expenses in an archive.

** Justification: Suppose users have old or outdated expenses but they do not want to permanently delete them as they may refer to these expenses again in the future for accounting purposes.
Users can simply archive these expenses, which *de-clutters their list of current expenses.* Furthermore, as users are able to group expenses into different archives, they are able to *better
organise past expenses.* Therefore, this feature contributes great value to the application, as it provides users with a method of organising and tracking their expenses in the long run.

** Highlights:
*** This enhancement works well with existing features and features to be added in future. This is because expenses that are archived cannot be edited (e.g. adding a tag) as they
are considered as "non active" expenses and are being kept as records only. Therefore the archive enhancement, in a sense, is isolated from the other expense modifying enhancements which
reduces the possibility of archive bugs.
*** A thorough analysis of any design alternatives was done to...
