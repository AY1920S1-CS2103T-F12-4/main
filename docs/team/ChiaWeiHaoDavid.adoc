== Introduction

=== Purpose of portfolio
The purpose of this portfolio is to document my overall contributions to the Software Engineering project, *Billboard*.

=== About the project
My team of 4 software engineering students and I were tasked with enhancing a basic command line
interface desktop addressbook application for our Software Engineering project. We decided to morph
it into a personal financial management system called *Billboard*.

This enhanced application enables students to record their daily expenses;
better manage and track expenses by tagging and archiving them;
and visually analyze overall spending by generating graphs from expense data.

This is what our project looks like:

.The graphical user interface for *Billboard*

The role I played in this project was to design and implement the code for the `archive` feature. Additionally, I was
tasked with improving the application's aesthetically design by adding cosmetic tweaks to the application's graphical user interface.
The following sections illustrate these enhancements in greater detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to the user and
developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

Note the following formatting used in this document:

|===
|`archive`|A grey highlight (called a mark-up) indicates that this is a command that can be inputted into the command line and executed by the application.

|`ArchiveWrapper`|Blue text with grey highlight indicates a component, class or object in the architecture of the application.

== Summary of contributions
This section summarises my coding, documentation, and other helpful contributions to the team project.

* *Major enhancement*: I added *the feature of archiving expenses*
** What it does: allows the user to archive old expenses. Multiple archives can be created, and the user will be able to revert/"unarchive" an expense should they choose.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as it helps achieve one of its goals of enabling students to better organise expenses. Archiving fulfills this
as it declutters the user's list of current expenses and also allows the user to separate expenses into different expense lists.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
