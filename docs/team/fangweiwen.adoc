---

== Overview

_Billboard_ is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still enjoying all the benefits of having a fully fledged Graphical User Interface (GUI).
It is written in Java, and has about 18 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the feature to undo/redo commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* *Minor enhancement*:
** added a history command that allows the user to view all the previous commands.
** added a feature that allows the user to to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.

== PROJECT: Augmented Reality Guided Aircraft Maintenance

---

== Overview

Aircraft technicians rely on physically printed Aircraft Maintenance Manuals(AMM) to do maintenance and
do not have any form of remote assistance solution available for them during work.
The project involves the development of a smartglass application that displays AMMs digitally and
also provides a remote connection between on-site workers and a remote expert,
and a web client that allows AMMs to be sent and updated real-time.
