== Introduction

_Billboard_ is for those who prefer to use desktop applications to manage and keep track of their expenses.
_Billboard_ is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still enjoying all the benefits of having a fully fledged Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, _Billboard_ can help you manage your expenses faster than traditional
GUI apps!

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed on your machine.
. Download the latest version of _Billboard_ https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F12-4/main/releases/tag/v1.1[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the Home folder for _Billboard_
. Double-click the file to open the application

*Command Format*

* Words in `[SQUARE BRACKETS]` are the mandatory parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `expense add [DESCRIPTION] [AMOUNT]`, `DESCRIPTION` and `AMOUNT` are parameters which can be used as `expense add “buy a book” 10`.
* The mandatory parameters must be supplied in the order specified.
* Default values can be specified in the square brackets, e.g `[NUM_ENTRIES, DEFAULT = 10]`. If the user does not provide a value for that parameter, it will default to the default value stated.
* Some commands may have optional parameters denoted under options. These can be included by specifying a flag, usually of the format `--flag` or `-f`. E.g `--description` can be used as `expense edit 2 --description "changed description"`.
* Flags can be in any order.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `bills`, `bills fees` etc.

// tag::archive[]
=== Archiving past expenses: `archive`
This feature allows you to archive expenses. An expense is archived when you want remove it from
the current list of expenses, but still want to keep a record of it and retrieve it again in the future
for accounting purposes.

Archiving expenses allows you to de-clutter your current list of expenses after a long period of time.
This feature offers greater flexibility in terms of expense organisation as it allows you to create *multiple archives* with
the archive name of your choice so that you would be able to appropriately group your archived expenses.

For example, if you still have the expense records of your weekly grocery shopping trips since several months ago in your main
list of expenses, you could archive them as "Groceries". This way, you would get rid of them from your main list of
expenses and at the end of the year, you would still be able to retrieve them if you want to account for your total annual grocery expenditure.

[NOTE]
*Archived expenses cannot be edited.* +
Archived expenses are not considered current and "active" expenses so you are unable to edit them. +
You would need to unarchive an expense first before you would be able to perform expense editing commands on it such as
`edit`, `tag add` and `tag remove` commands.

Although this section of the user guide provides comprehensive information on the usage of `archive` commands,
you could also view the list of all supported archive commands within the application by typing the command word `archive`
into the command box and pressing `Enter`:

.The result box will display the list of supported `archive` commands. You can scroll down to view the full list.

The following are all the archive commands, descriptions of how they work and their usage.

==== _Adding an expense to an archive: ``archive add``_ +
This command allows you to transfer the expense at the specified index to your specified archive. +
If the archive you entered does not exist, then a new archive is created before the expense is added. +
 +
Usage:

 archive add [INDEX] arc/[ARCHIVE NAME]

Parameters:

* [INDEX]: The main list index of the expense you want to archive.
* `arc/`: Prefix to indicate that the text appended to it is the specified archive name.
* [ARCHIVE NAME]: Specified name of archive to add expense into. Archive name is case-sensitive and must be non-empty.
Names with symbols and multiple words are accepted as well.

1. Type `archive add 7 arc/movies` into the command box, and press `Enter` to execute the command:
+
.The expense "_joker movie tickets_" is at index 7 in the list.
image:archiveAddEnterCommand.png[]

2. The next step can be split into 2 scenarios:

* 2a. *There is no existing archive called "_movies_"* +
A new archive called "_movies_" is created before "_joker movie tickets_" is added to it. +
The result will display the message to indicate the archive creation and transfer of the expense:
+
image::archiveAddArchiveCreatedMessage.png[]

* 2b. *There is an existing archive called "_movies_"* +

arguments (like [INDEX]) to be entered for this command.

Example:

"_movies_", you can execute this command to bring up the expense list in "_movies_":

1. Type `archive list movies` into the command box, and press `Enter` to execute it:
+

3. The next step can be split into two scenarios:
* 3a. *"_Avengers Endgame_" is the only expense in the "_movies_" archive.* +
After the command is executed, "_Avengers Endgame_" is deleted so the "_movies_" archive is now empty, and will thus be deleted. +
The result box will display the message that indicates the deletion of "_Avengers Endgame_" and "_movies_", and the list displayed will switch back to the main expense list:
