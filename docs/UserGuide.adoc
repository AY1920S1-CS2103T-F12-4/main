*Command Format*

* Words in `[SQUARE BRACKETS]` are the mandatory parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `expense add [DESCRIPTION] [AMOUNT]`, `DESCRIPTION` and `AMOUNT` are parameters which can be used as `expense add “buy a book” 10`.
* The mandatory parameters must be supplied in the order specified.
* Default values can be specified in the square brackets, e.g `[NUM_ENTRIES, DEFAULT = 10]`. If the user does not provide a value for that parameter, it will default to the default value stated.
* Some commands may have optional parameters denoted under options. These can be included by specifying a flag, usually of the format `--flag` or `-f`. E.g `--description` can be used as `expense edit 2 --description "changed description"`.
* Flags can be in any order.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `bills`, `bills fees` etc.
