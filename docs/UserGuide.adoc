== Introduction

_Billboard_ is for those who prefer to use desktop applications to manage and keep track of their expenses.
_Billboard_ is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still enjoying all the benefits of having a fully fledged Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, _Billboard_ can help you manage your expenses faster than traditional
GUI apps!

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed on your machine.
. Download the latest version of _Billboard_ https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F12-4/main/releases/tag/v1.1[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the Home folder for _Billboard_
. Double-click the file to open the application
. Refer to <<Features>> for the details of each command

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `[SQUARE BRACKETS]` are the mandatory parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `expense add [DESCRIPTION] [AMOUNT]`, `DESCRIPTION` and `AMOUNT` are parameters which can be used as `expense add “buy a book” 10`.
* The mandatory parameters must be supplied in the order specified.
* Default values can be specified in the square brackets, e.g `[NUM_ENTRIES, DEFAULT = 10]`. If the user does not provide a value for that parameter, it will default to the default value stated.
* Some commands may have optional parameters denoted under options. These can be included by specifying a flag, usually of the format `--flag` or `-f`. E.g `--description` can be used as `expense edit 2 --description "changed description"`.
* Flags can be in any order.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `bills`, `bills fees` etc.

// tag::archive[]
=== Archiving past expenses: `archive`
This feature allows you to archive expenses. An expense is archived when you want remove it from
the current list of expenses, but still want to keep a record of it and retrieve it again in the future
for accounting purposes.

Archiving expenses allows you to de-clutter your current list of expenses after a long period of time.
This feature offers greater flexibility in terms of expense organisation as it allows you to create *multiple archives* with
the archive name of your choice so that you would be able to appropriately group your archived expenses.

NOTE: *Archived expenses cannot be edited.* +
Archived expenses are not considered current and "active" expenses so you are unable to edit them. +
You would need to unarchive an expense first before you would be able to perform expense editing commands on it such as
`edit`, `tag add` and `tag remove` commands.

Although this section of the user guide provides comprehensive information on the usage of `archive` commands,
you could also view the list of all supported archive commands within the application by typing the command word `archive`
into the command box and pressing `Enter`:

.The result box will display the list of supported `archive` commands. You can scroll down to view the full list.
image::archiveCommandMessage.png[]

The following are all the archive commands, descriptions of how they work and their usage.

NOTE: Note the formatting of command parameters used in this section: +
[INDEX]: The list index of the expense involved in the command. +
`arc/`: Prefix to indicate that the text appended to it is the specified archive name. +
[ARCHIVE NAME]: Specified name of archive involved in the command. Archive name is case-sensitive and must be non-empty.
Names with symbols and multiple words are accepted as well.

==== _Adding an expense to an archive: ``archive add``_ +
This command allows you to transfer the expense at the specified index to your specified archive. +
If the archive you entered does not exist, then a new archive is created before the expense is added. +
 +

Suppose you want to archive the expense called "_joker movie tickets_" to an archive called "_movies_". +
To archive the expense:

1. Type `archive add 7 arc/movies` into the command box, and press `Enter` to execute the command:
+
.The expense "_joker movie tickets_" is at index 7 in the list.

A new archive called "_movies_" is created before "_joker movie tickets_" is added to it. +
The result box will display the message to indicate the archive creation and transfer of the expense:
+
image::archiveAddArchiveCreatedMessage.png[]

* 2b. *There is an existing archive called "_movies_"* +
"_joker movie tickets_" is simply added to the existing "_movies_" archive. +
The result box will display the message to indicate the transfer of the expense:

==== _Listing out all archives: ``archive listall``_ +
This command informs you of all the existing archives by displaying a list of all existing archive names. +
{nbsp} +
Usage:

This command allows you to view the list of expenses of your specified archive. +
{nbsp} +
Usage:

 archive list [ARCHIVE NAME]

NOTE: You do not need to prepend the archive prefix `arc/` to the archive name as there are no other
arguments (like [INDEX]) to be entered for this command.

Example:

Suppose you want to view all the expenses you have spend on movies this year. As you have kept all movie expenses in an archive called
"_movies_", you can execute this command to bring up the expense list in "_movies_":

If the archived expense you delete was the last expense in the archive, the empty archive will be deleted. +
{nbsp} +
Usage:

 archive delete [INDEX] arc/[ARCHIVE NAME]

Example:

Suppose you want to delete the expense "_Avengers Endgame_" from the "_movies_" archive as you know you will never need to retrieve again for future reference. +
To delete "_Avengers Endgame_" from its archive:

1. Enter the `archive list movies` command to display the expense list of the "_movies_" archive. Refer to the `archive list` section above for the diagram to execute this step.
2. With the expense list of "_movies_" displayed, type `archive delete 1 arc/movies` and press `Enter`:
+
."Avengers Endgame" expense has an index of 1 in its archive list.
image::archiveDeleteEnterCommand.png[]

3. The next step can be split into two scenarios:
* 3a. *"_Avengers Endgame_" is the only expense in the "_movies_" archive.* +
After the command is executed, "_Avengers Endgame_" is deleted so the "_movies_" archive is now empty, and will thus be deleted. +
The result box will display the message that indicates the deletion of "_Avengers Endgame_" and "_movies_", and the list displayed will switch back to the main expense list:
+
.Since the archive is deleted, the list displayed switches back to the main expense list.
image::archiveDeleteEmptyArchive.png[]

* 3b. *"_Avengers Endgame_" is not the only expense in the "_movies_" archive.* +
After the command is executed, "_Avengers Endgame_" is deleted. As there are other expenses still in the "_movies_" archive, the archive is not deleted. +
The result box will display the message that indicates the deletion of "_Avengers Endgame_", and the archive list displayed updates with the removal of "_Avengers Endgame_":
+
."_Avengers Endgame_" is deleted and this change is immediately reflected in the archive list displayed.
image::archiveDeleteNonEmptyArchive.png[]

{nbsp} +

==== _Reverting an archived expense: archive revert_ +

Suppose you have an expense "_Airpod Pro_" archived into "_gadgets_", but you changed your mind and decided that it should not be archived yet. +
To unarchive/revert the "_Airpod Pro_" expense:

1. Enter the `archive list gadgets` command to display the expense list of the "_gadgets_" archive. Refer to the `archive list` section above for the diagram to execute this step.
2. With the expense list of "_gadgets_" displayed, type `archive revert 2 arc/gadgets` and press `Enter`:
+
."Airpod Pro" expense has an index of 2 in its archive list.
image::archiveRevertEnterCommand.png[]

3. The next step can be split into two scenarios:
* 3a. *"_Airpod Pro_" is the only expense in the "_gadgets_" archive.* +
After the command is executed, "_Airpod Pro_" is removed from the "_gadgets_" archive, so the archive is now empty, and will thus be deleted. +
The result box will display the message that indicates the transfer of "_Airpod Pro_" and the deletion of "_gadgets_", and the list displayed will switch back to the main expense list:
+
.Since the archive is deleted, the list displayed switches back to the main expense list and "_Airpod Pro_" can be observed to be back in the main expense list.
image::archiveRevertEmptyArchive.png[]

* 3b. *"_Airpod Pro_" is not the only expense in the "_gadgets_" archive.* +
After the command is executed, "_Airpod Pro_" is removed from the "_gadgets_" archive. As there are other expenses still in the "_gadgets_" archive, the archive is not deleted. +
The result box will display the message that indicates the transfer of "_Airpod Pro_", and the archive list displayed updates with the removal of "_Airpod Pro_":
