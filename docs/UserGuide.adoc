== Introduction

_Billboard_ is for those who prefer to use desktop applications to manage and keep track of their expenses.
_Billboard_ is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still enjoying all the benefits of having a fully fledged Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, _Billboard_ can help you manage your expenses faster than traditional
GUI apps!

== Quick Start

. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed on your machine.
. Download the latest version of _Billboard_ https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-F12-4/main/releases/tag/v1.1[here].
. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the Home folder for _Billboard_
. Double-click the file to open the application
. Refer to <<Features>> for the details of each command

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `[SQUARE BRACKETS]` are the mandatory parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `expense add [DESCRIPTION] [AMOUNT]`, `DESCRIPTION` and `AMOUNT` are parameters which can be used as `expense add “buy a book” 10`.
* The mandatory parameters must be supplied in the order specified.
* Default values can be specified in the square brackets, e.g `[NUM_ENTRIES, DEFAULT = 10]`. If the user does not provide a value for that parameter, it will default to the default value stated.
* Some commands may have optional parameters denoted under options. These can be included by specifying a flag, usually of the format `--flag` or `-f`. E.g `--description` can be used as `expense edit 2 --description "changed description"`.
* Flags can be in any order.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `bills`, `bills fees` etc.
